# CSC-11300-Movie-Ratings-Analysis---Python
A partnered project worked on by @BVasquez07 and I with the goal of examining two directories and analyzing the data that we get from said directories.
The raw data could be accessed at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest and in the 'ml-latest.zip' file.
